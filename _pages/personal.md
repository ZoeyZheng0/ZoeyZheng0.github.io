- My Chinese name is Wanrong (莞蓉). The first character, Wan (莞), signifies smiles, while the second character, Rong (蓉), represents flowers.

- You're also welcome to call me Zoey. I chose this name because it reminds me of a smart and nimble girl, which I like to think fits me well.

- I enjoy documenting every detail of my life, and Notion is an essential tool that helps me do this. Here's one example: My 2023 Reading [Notes](https://zoeyzheng0808.notion.site/826e60274e994e8c92422d77d65a98a7?v=bbfec64e9a574ff88fb67a853552b4f0).
