- My Chinese name is Wanrong (莞蓉). The first character Wan (莞) means smiles and the second character Rong (蓉) means flowers. 

- You can also call me Zoey. This name reminds me of a smart and nimble girl, which is pretty like me, so I take it as my English name.

- My favorite films are: 
    - the Fight Club
    - 2001: A Space Odyssey
