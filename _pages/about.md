## About me
Hi there, my name is __Wanrong (Zoey) Zheng__ [\[CV\]](https://ZoeyZheng0.github.io/files/CV.pdf). 

I am an M.S. Computer Science student at [USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), advised by Prof. [Ram Nevatia](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/professor-ram-nevatia/) and Prof. [Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/).
Before USC, I was working in [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en) as fulltime Computer Vision researcher (2019-2021).

My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, especially include Data-centric and Human-centric AI. My long-term research goal is to build a data-driven AI system that: (1) recognizes and represents scenes effectively; (2) is adaptive to multi-modalities (vision, language, spatial information, etc.); (3) can be reconstructed, understood, and corrected by humans.

Specifically, My current research focuses include: 
- __Person Re-Identification__: retrieving the same individual based on human pose, gait, and face information,
- __3D vision__: representing and reconstructing 3-D dynamic human shape and pose, 
- __Explainable Artificial Intelligence__: transparent and effective human-in-the-loop learning, 
- __Face Recognition__: high performance large scale Face Recognition task with real-world multi-race data.
